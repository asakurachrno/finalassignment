Hearthstone is a free-to-play online digital collectible card game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Originally subtitled Heroes of Warcraft, Hearthstone builds upon the existing lore of the Warcraft series by using the same elements, characters, and relics.
<br>
<br>
In this digital card game, players pit their wits and skills in a 1-v-1 match to overcome their opponents using various strategies.
<br>
<br>
Hearthstone is also particularly captivating as many of the cards have their own animations, which is visually more appealing than other card games such as Magic: The Gathering and Yugioh.

With 10 playable classes entirely free to unlock, players can opt to have different strategies to suit their playstyle, be it aggressive, combo-based or control-type!
All classes have unique cards and abilities, known as hero powers, which help define class archetypes. Each player uses a deck of cards from their collection with the end goal being to reduce the opponent's health to zero. There are four different types of cards: minions, spells, weapons, and hero cards. These cards are ordered by rarity, with Legendary cards being the rarest, followed by Epic, Rare, Common, and Basic. Blizzard releases expansions of additional cards every four months to increase the variety in the metagame. The game uses a freemium model of revenue, meaning players can play for free or pay to acquire additional card packs or content.
