MapleStory is a free-to-play, 2D, side-scrolling massively multiplayer online role-playing game, developed by South Korean company Wizet. Several versions of the game are available for specific countries or regions, and each is published by various companies such as Nexon.

Since its introduction in Singapore in 2005, Maplestory has been a hit with many teenagers and young adults alike. With a selection of 40+ different classes and immersive background stories to boot, there is something for everyone!

What is lesser known, is that Maplestory started out as a social platform. In its earlier story lines, there was no end goal objective except to improve the skills of players and to allow like-minded people to band together and socialise.
Eventually, more story content was added to promote the game as more of an action RPG (Role-playing game). Similarly to Genshin Impact, the game is free to play but have many systems in place that allows players to progress further with money.

This game is suitable for players of any age, with its spritely colours for the young and deep storyline for the mature audiences. In addition, I'm sure this will bring a bout of nostalgia for those who grew up playing the game!
