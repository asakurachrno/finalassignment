<p style="text-align: left; font-color: black;">In today's age of technology, one hobby that have connected many people around the world is games.
 Online video games can allow players to talk to others and make friends at their current ability level even when they are not emotionally or physically able to leave their homes.
 In fact, research has shown that many people who meet while playing games online do end up spending time with those people.
